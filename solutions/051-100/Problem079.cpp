/* Passcode derivation
 * A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three
 * random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278,
 * they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would
 * be: 317.
 *
 * The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
 *
 * Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the
 * file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown
 * length. */

int main() {

}

/* First thoughts
 * 1. This problem requires storing and updating the passcode as we look at each
 * new key. The passcode must be valid for every key in the file. This means
 * that the relative positions of the digits in the key must be found within the
 * passcode. If it is not found, we must update the passcode so that it becomes
 * valid for that particular key.
 * 2. This problem  becomes easier to analyze if we sort the keys and remove any
 * duplicates.
 * 3. There are three cases where the passcode can be invalid, given a
 * particular key and the order of its digits. Either 1 digit in the sequence is
 * missing, 2 digits in the sequence are missing, or the entire sequence is
 * missing. */
